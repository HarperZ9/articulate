# Series review and your own voice

Two features for authors. Series review reads several of your documents
together and shows the patterns a reader notices across them. Your own voice is
a profile you build from your own writing, on your own computer, so you can
compare a draft with how you write and, when you ask, shape your draft toward
it.

Neither feature writes your experiences for you. Where your perspective would
help, Articulate asks a question and leaves the answer to you.

## Series review

```bash
articulate corpus essays/*.md
articulate titles essays/*.md
articulate interview essays/draft.md --out essays/draft.marked.md
articulate restructure essays/draft.md --out essays/draft.restructured.md
```

`corpus` names patterns that only show across a set: one title formula used
again and again, phrases shared by three or more pieces, the same paragraph
scaffold (claim, source, confidence, limit) in most paragraphs, sections of
near-equal length, sentence lengths that barely vary, long stretches with no
author present, and runs of paragraphs with no number, date, name or place.
Each finding has its location, what it costs a reader, and a direction. None
proposes replacement prose, and none gates a build. `--keep FILE` lists phrases
you repeat on purpose. `--receipt OUT` writes an `articulate/corpus-receipt/v1`
receipt that `articulate verify` replays.

`titles` groups titles by skeleton ("The Map Is Not the Road" and "The Vote Is
Not the Law" share `the X is not the X`) and asks, for each repeated title, how
you would describe the piece to a friend. With `--answers FILE` it offers up to
three suggestions built only from the words of your answer.

`interview` asks questions only you can answer, each at its lines: why the
piece matters to you, what you saw yourself, whether you would stake your name
on a claim. It never answers them. `--out` writes a copy with an inert marker
after each question; `--collect FILE` gathers your answers into a file that an
edit plan can bind as your own words.

`restructure` proposes moving per-paragraph source, confidence and limit lines
into one "Sources and method" section, with an anchor left in place. It refuses
the proposal unless every sentence, citation, URL, number, quote and disclosure
survives byte for byte.

## Your own voice

```bash
articulate voice learn my-essays/*.md --name mine --mine
articulate voice show mine
articulate voice compare draft.md --name mine
articulate voice apply draft.md --name mine --authored-by-me --out plan.json
articulate voice delete --all
```

`learn` builds a profile from the files you name, and only after `--mine` says
they are your own writing. The profile holds measured aggregates: sentence and
paragraph length ranges, how your sentences open, how often you concede, give a
reason, ask a question or write in the first person, and function-word rates.
It never stores a sentence of your samples, and names of people and places are
dropped before the vocabulary field is built (`--no-vocabulary` leaves that
field out). Below about 5,000 words of samples the profile says it is
indicative only.

`show` prints every stored field as a plain sentence and the file's path.
`compare` places a draft against your own range, feature by feature, and points
at long stretches with no author present. It gives no total and no rewritten
text.

`apply` plans an edit of your own draft toward your measured habits. It runs
only with `--authored-by-me`, and the plan binds the profile's name and hash.
The calling model writes the rewrite; `articulate voice submit` checks it. The
meaning guard keeps every protected span, and a rewrite that adds a first-person
sentence with no source in your draft or your supplied words is refused for that
paragraph. Before and after counts of features outside your range are reported
and never decide what is accepted.

### Where it lives, and who it belongs to

The store is one folder: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\articulate\voice` on Windows,
`~/.local/share/articulate/voice` elsewhere, or `ARTICULATE_VOICE_DIR`. The
first write adds a `.gitignore` holding `*`. `identity.json` holds a random
owner id made on your computer, and every profile records the owner it was
learned under. `compare` and `apply` refuse a profile from another owner.

`voice export NAME --out FILE` and `voice import FILE` move a profile to your
other computers. On a computer with no identity yet, `--adopt-identity` takes
the export's owner. A store never accepts a second owner.

The binding is a consent and provenance record. A local user who edits the
JSON can defeat it, so it is not access control.

### What leaves your computer

Learning, comparing, exporting and deleting happen on your computer and send
nothing anywhere. No MCP tool learns, exports, imports or deletes a profile. In
`apply`, the profile's plain-sentence description enters the conversation with
the calling model, because that model writes the rewrite. Your sample text never
does: the profile holds none.

## The house voice is separate

The [house voice](house-voice.md) is the model's own voice. It never reads your
voice store, and it is never applied to text you wrote. Your voice shapes only
text you say is yours, and only when you run `voice apply`.

## Limits

- Move labels come from cue words and mislabel some sentences; reports show
  excerpts so you can judge.
- Thresholds are starting values from a small set of essays.
- A draft inside your measured range can still not sound like you, and one
  outside it can. The profile measures surface habits, not voice in any deeper
  sense.
- No feature here calls an AI-authorship detector or reports a humanness score.
