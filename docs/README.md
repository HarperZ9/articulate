# Articulate documentation

Articulate checks prose on your computer. It flags writing patterns common in weak prose and in model output, scores how densely a passage uses them, and can rewrite a draft with a model you choose. The checker runs on the Python standard library with no network call.

```bash
python -m pip install articulate-writing
articulate check README.md --profile readme --gate
```

## Read in this order

- [Getting started](getting-started.md): install, a first check, a first receipt,
  and an editor squiggle in about five minutes.
- [Walkthrough](walkthrough.md): one document from check to rewrite to a
  committed receipt.
- [Features](features.md): every capability and how to reach it, including
  profiles, modes, genres, the editor, receipts, and the LSP, SARIF and MCP surfaces.
- [CLI reference](cli.md): each command and every flag, with the exit codes.
- [What results mean](boundaries.md): what a check result and a receipt cover.

Articulate finds writing patterns and shows where they are. Use it to improve
writing. Use other evidence to decide who wrote a text. On 183 texts of known
origin it flagged all 84 AI texts and 57 of 75 human texts (76%, 95% interval
65% to 84%), among them 10 of 18 essays by English learners
([`results.json`](../corpus/provenance/results.json)). Teachers: use it to help a
student improve a draft, and use other evidence to judge who wrote an essay.
