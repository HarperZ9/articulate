articulate.modes -- writing modes: domain style x articulation need.

A mode crosses a DOMAIN register (a base profile) with an ARTICULATION (explain,
persuade, instruct, narrate, argue, prove: what the prose does to the reader). The
`prove` articulation makes a proof legible for a reader; it never means the tool
verified the theorem. A mode is
the base profile plus a small delta: an optional slop override, terms of art to
keep, categories to gate even under a flavored base (gate_promote), and editor
guidance. Adding a mode is adding one record, not editing the engine.

A mode tunes style WITHIN the plain-writing standard. It may tighten the gate and
add terms of art. It may not re-enable a banned HIGH device, with one exception:
literary narrative maps to slop=off, where authorial voice governs and nothing
gates. Detection and quality only; never evasion.

Source: the domain x articulation study (2026-09-17). Two proposed detector
categories (legalese-archaism, unproven-claim) are noted where a mode wants them
and are deferred until their patterns ship. Standard library only.
