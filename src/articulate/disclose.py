"""articulate.disclose -- a statement of tool use and contributor credit, from the log.

The statement has two parts. Assistance lists each tool the writer declared, its
version, the task verb as recorded (generated, drafted, edited, translated) and
where. Contributor credit lists CRediT roles, and only people hold them. The
lines it holds to:

  - it never lists a model or a tool as an author;
  - it refuses a claim that matches its list of no-tool phrases while the log
    holds an assistance entry (a listed-pattern check; a paraphrase can pass);
  - it refuses to name a product as an author: a name that is, as a whole, a
    product name, or an entry whose "type" is not "person";
  - it takes its verb from the recorded task, so generation never reads as
    help with editing;
  - it refuses to leave out an assistance entry the log holds;
  - input-method entries (dictation and the like) stay out unless the writer
    includes them by name.

A statement records what the writer declared. It cannot settle who composed
any words or the copyright status of model output.
Standard library only.
