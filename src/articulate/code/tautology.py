"""articulate.code.tautology -- checks in a test that cannot fail (check B4).

The cheap subset only: `assert True`, a value compared with itself (directly or
through a local name), the code's own output used as its expected value, an
assertion whose only subject is a mock the test configured, a test with no check
at all, and a test whose only checks are bare `assert_called` calls.

Static and approximate. A name is resolved through single assignments inside the
same test, at most three hops; nothing outside the test body is resolved, so a
tautology spread across fixtures is not seen. Standard library only.
