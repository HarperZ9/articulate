"""Find and start the claude CLI for the editor layer.

The judge, fix and polish commands run the model through the local `claude` CLI
in headless mode. Two things break a bare "claude" on Windows. A process that
a bundler or an MCP host starts can inherit a PATH that holds only System32.
And subprocess without a shell asks CreateProcess for the name, which appends
.exe and never finds the claude.cmd shim that an npm install puts on the PATH.

So the CLI path comes from ARTICULATE_CLAUDE_CLI when that variable is set, and
the value must be an absolute path. Otherwise the resolver walks the absolute
PATH entries itself. It looks for claude.exe in every entry first and falls back
to a batch shim only when no claude.exe exists. It never searches the current
directory: shutil.which does on Windows, so a document repo that ships a file
named claude.cmd would run in place of the real CLI. When nothing runnable is
found, the caller gets ClaudeUnavailable, whose message names the variable. No
message here prints the value of the variable or the resolved path.

The prompt always travels in a temporary file passed with
--append-system-prompt-file, and argv holds a fixed line, that path and fixed
flags. A long prompt would pass the Windows command-line limit or the Linux
per-argument limit. And a .cmd or .bat file runs under cmd.exe, which parses
its arguments a second time: it cuts one at the first newline and reads
% ^ & | < > ! as commands, and ")" too when the argument is not quoted. For a
batch file every argument is checked before the start, and a path that holds
one of those characters is refused.

The document is untrusted input. Every call turns off the built-in tools, all
MCP servers and the project and local settings. The CLI reads those settings,
hooks included, from its working directory, and -p skips the trust prompt. So
the child runs in a private empty folder, never in the caller's. On Windows the
child also gets NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath=1: an npm claude.cmd shim
runs "node" by bare name, and cmd.exe would look for it in the working folder
first. A timeout stops the whole process tree, since a batch shim runs the CLI
as a grandchild that would otherwise keep the pipes open.
