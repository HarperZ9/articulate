articulate.receipt -- re-derivable verdicts.

A receipt records a detection result together with the exact text hash and
ruleset fingerprint that produced it. Anyone can replay it: recompute the
findings on the same text under the same ruleset and confirm they match, without
trusting whoever issued the receipt first. The verdict uses a closed lattice,
Match / Drift / Unverifiable, and there is deliberately no Trusted or Approved
value: the receipt certifies re-derivability, never authority.

  Match         same text, same ruleset, identical findings and gate.
  Drift         same text and ruleset, but the re-derived findings differ
                (the detector code changed outside the pinned patterns, or the
                receipt was altered).
  Unverifiable  the ruleset changed, the text does not match the receipt's hash,
                or the receipt schema is unknown. Re-derivation cannot be done,
                so nothing is asserted.

A content-free AUDIT receipt (schema `articulate/receipt/audit/v1`) keeps no verbatim
document text: it drops the per-finding `match` substring and the exact start/end/col
offsets, keeping only the rule id, tier, category, and line. A team retains and
replays such a record without storing the sensitive text. It is content-free, never
information-free: which rules fired and roughly where (line) remain, which for a
closed-vocabulary rule narrows the flagged token to that rule's small, public
candidate set. The "hash" mode keeps a sha256 of the match for an equality check
against a known string; it is not confidentiality, because most rules draw from a
public closed vocabulary a holder can enumerate and hash. Use "drop" when the flagged
word must stay secret.

Standard library only; no network.
