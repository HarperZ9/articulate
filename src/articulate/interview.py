"""The authorship interview: questions only the author can answer, placed at
the lines that prompted them.

questions() picks fixed questions by measured triggers, so the same text
always gets the same questions. mark() returns a copy of the text with an
inert HTML comment after each location. The author writes answers under the
markers, in their own words, wherever they choose. collect() lists the
markers still unanswered and lifts the answered ones out, so the answers can
go to an edit as author-supplied text. Nothing here writes prose or answers a
question, and no model is called.
