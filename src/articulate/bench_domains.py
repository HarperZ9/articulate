"""
articulate.bench_domains -- the regression corpus for the domain rule packs.

`corpus/domains/expect.json` names, for each sample, the profile to check it
under and the exact set of rule-pack categories it must produce. A flagged
sample must produce exactly its listed categories; a clean sample must produce
none of them and pass its profile's gate. A mismatch in either direction counts,
so a pack that stops firing and a pack that starts firing on clean text both
fail the run.

The samples are short and synthetic, written to exercise each rule. They measure
that the rules still do what they did, and nothing about recall or precision on
real documents. The exit code is the number of mismatches.
