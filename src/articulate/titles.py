"""Title skeletons, title families and the title workshop.

A skeleton keeps a title's closed-class words (articles, prepositions,
copulas, negators, question words, auxiliaries, pronouns) and turns each run
of other words into X. "The Sandbox Was Never Just a Box" becomes
"the X was never just a X". Families group skeletons by ordered rules, so a
series that leans on one shape shows it as one family with its member titles.

The workshop asks the author what each piece is about in their own words and,
only when given that one-line answer, offers up to three plain variants built
from the answer's words and the document's own heading terms. Each variant is
labelled a suggestion. Nothing here writes a title into a file.
