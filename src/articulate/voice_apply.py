"""voice apply: shape the user's own draft toward their measured habits.

It runs only when the user asks, names the profile, and attests the draft is
their own writing (--authored-by-me, or authored_by_user true over MCP). The
profile must belong to this computer's voice identity. The plan binds the
profile's name and hash (articulate/edit-plan/v2), the instructions carry the
profile's plain-sentence description as data, and submit refuses the rewrite
when the profile changed after planning.

The meaning guard runs as for any host edit, with the first-person check and
disclosure spans. Before and after, submit reports how many measured features
sit outside the user's range. Those counts never decide acceptance, and nothing
loops on them.

In apply the profile's aggregate sentences enter the host conversation, because
the host model writes the rewrite. Sample text never does: the profile holds
none.
