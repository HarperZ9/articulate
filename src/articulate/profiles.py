articulate.profiles -- the register-adaptive profile system.

Ported from the flywheel writing_lint profile library and adapted to drive the
Articulate detector's precision tiers. A profile is a register configuration
(Halliday field/tenor/mode) expressed as data: it sets a `slop` level that
decides which detector tiers hard-gate, a `keep` list of terms of art the
detector must never flag, and provenance fields. Adding a prose type is adding a
record here, not editing the engine.

This scores the FORM of prose, never its substance or authenticity, and it never
tries to defeat AI detection. Those are non-goals, stated so no reader assumes
otherwise.

The detector's vocabulary is its own regex pattern set, so the flywheel word
lists (and their en-GB false positives like `whilst`/`amongst`) are not carried
over. Standard library only.
