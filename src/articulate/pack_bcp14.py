articulate.pack_bcp14 -- RFC 2119 / RFC 8174 keyword consistency, run inside the
`normative-spec` register.

BCP 14 is RFC 2119 as updated by RFC 8174. Its eleven keywords are MUST, MUST
NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, NOT
RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL. Under RFC 8174 they carry their special meaning
only in all capitals, and a document that uses them should say so with the
boilerplate sentence that cites BCP 14.

  bcp14-mixed-case (HIGH)    a keyword phrase in mixed case: "MUST not",
                             "SHOULD not", "must NOT", "NOT recommended". Its
                             force is ambiguous, so it gates.
  bcp14-no-boilerplate (MEDIUM)  capital keywords in a document that never cites
                             BCP 14, RFC 2119, or RFC 8174.
  bcp14-may-not (MEDIUM)     "MAY NOT", which neither RFC defines. Write MUST NOT
                             for a prohibition, or say the step is not required.
  bcp14-lowercase (LOW)      a lowercase "must", "shall", or "should" in a
                             document that declares BCP 14. Under RFC 8174 it has
                             its plain English sense; write it in capitals if a
                             requirement is meant. Lowercase "may", "required",
                             "recommended", and "optional" are left alone, since
                             they are common plain words.
  bcp14-shall-must (LOW)     both SHALL and MUST in one document. RFC 2119 makes
                             them synonyms, so the mix reads as two strengths.
  bcp14-old-boilerplate (LOW)  a declaration that cites RFC 2119 without the RFC
                             8174 clause "when, and only when, they appear in all
                             capitals".

English only. Standard library only.
