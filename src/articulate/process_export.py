"""articulate.process_export -- the Articulate process summary, and verify.

`<document>.process-summary.json`, schema articulate/process-summary/v1. The
default export holds the document hashes, the entry sequence with days, each
draft's commitment, the declared assistance, review roles and outcomes, and the
disclosure statement. Every other field (word counts, diff sizes, times,
shareable labels and citations, input methods, reviewer names) is added only
when the writer names it. `reveal` attaches the text and salt of chosen drafts
so a reader can check each against its commitment.

No exported value is computed from a withheld field. An entry hash covers every
field, so a reader holding one could test guesses at a withheld word count, time
or citation; the export leaves entry hashes out.

The actions list follows the C2PA data model so a signed manifest could be built
from it later: the first action is c2pa.created or c2pa.opened, each action
carries its own IPTC digital source type, sections are textual changes, and a
translation carries BCP 47 source and target languages. People stay out of the
actions. This file is unsigned. It is not a Content Credential and not an EU AI
Act Article 50 marking.

`verify` reports intact, broken or missing, with reasons. It reports no gaps, no
intervals between entries and no clock notes. Standard library only.
