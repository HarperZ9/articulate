articulate.genres -- the genre axis for narrative and expressive prose.

A register profile answers "what is this document's field, tenor, mode". A genre
answers a different question: is this literary fiction, category fiction, a young
adult novel, a screenplay, a poem, or a memoir. Each genre reads by its own
conventions, so a scanner tuned for an essay misreads a novel. This module adds
that axis as data. Adding a genre is adding one record here, not editing the
scanner.

A genre record carries the register base it builds on plus a few genre fields the
detector consumes:

  slop                 which precision tiers gate. Fiction and verse sit at
                       "off": authorial voice governs and nothing blocks. A
                       screenplay sits at "flavored" so the banned devices still
                       gate on action lines, where economy is the craft rule.
  unit                 "sentence" by default, or "line" for verse, where a line
                       break is the unit and sentence-length cadence does not apply.
  structural_classify  "fountain" for a screenplay: each line is typed by role
                       (slug, action, cue, parenthetical, dialogue) before any
                       prose rule runs, so only action faces device scrutiny.
  dialogue_exempt      mask quoted speech before the device passes, so a
                       character's line is read in the character's voice and is
                       never scored as the author's own prose.
  quote_exempt_all     the stricter memoir rule: quoted testimony is excluded
                       from every category, because those quotes are often
                       recalled and rescoring or rewriting them is a factual error.
  fiction_slop         run the report-only fiction lexicon (generation artifacts
                       such as the somatic cliche). It is an advisory, never a gate.
  suppress_categories  craft-device categories a genre removes from the report
                       outright, because they name legitimate technique in that
                       genre. Verse removes antithesis, the triad, the contrast
                       pair, and the cadence signal.

The lexicon and every genre default here score the FORM of prose against genre
convention. They never judge whether the writing is authentic, and they never
try to defeat AI detection. Standard library only.
