"""articulate.desk_inside -- the "Inside the document" half of the desk.

Deterministic checks of the document's own statements, each turned into one
question for a reviewer: a number with no source nearby, an appeal to unnamed
authority, a section or statement the venue asks for and cannot find, text that
does not show to a reader, and the one process question a venue may set for
every submission alike. Quotations and code are skipped.

It loads two rule families and no others: the unsupported-authority pattern
and the instruction-injection patterns (used only to say whether hidden text
is addressed to a model). No style rule, no density and no per-paragraph gate.
Standard library only.
