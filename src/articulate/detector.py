check-writing-devices.py  ("Articulate")

A detector for AI prose tells and a configured set of banned rhetorical devices. It
reads a prose file and reports, with line numbers, where the machine-writing
tells sit so a human can fix them at the source. This is a DETECTION and QUALITY
tool. It finds tells; it does not remove them, does not rewrite, and has no mode
whose purpose is to slip past another detector. Passing a detector is a byproduct
of writing plainly, not a goal this tool serves.

What it looks for, in three confidence tiers:

  HIGH    Mechanically unambiguous devices the standard bans outright, plus the
          named register words. Low false-positive rate. These are hits.
  MEDIUM  Strong tells of current frontier-model prose (Opus 5, Fable 5.1,
          Sol 5.6, Astra 6): the "delve" register, stock transitions and
          openers, trailing participial closers, marketing superlatives. Small
          false-positive rate. Also hits.
  LOW     Heuristics that catch a real pattern but fire on innocent prose too
          (rule-of-three lists, bold list lead-ins, emoji, uniform cadence).
          Reported as advisories, summarised by count, expanded with --verbose.

"clean" means no HIGH and no MEDIUM hit. LOW advisories never block; they inform.

Methodology. The lexical and structural checks draw on Williams, "Style: Lessons
in Clarity and Grace" (characters as subjects, actions as verbs, old-before-new
cohesion, cut empty openers and stacked nominalizations), on Orwell and Gowers
for plain-word discipline, and on a live survey of current-model tells. The rule
behind the design: flag, never suggest. The tool marks where prose reads as
machine-written and leaves the rewrite to the person, because a replacement word
the model picks is itself the contamination (Ptacek's point: readers catch
model-selected words in the parts per trillion). So there is no "fix it for me"
mode, and there is no mode that tunes output toward a lower detector score. A
lower score is a byproduct of clearer writing, never the target.

Usage (CLI):   python check-writing-devices.py FILE [FILE ...] [--verbose] [--json] [--passes]
Usage (hook):  called by lint-on-save.sh with a path; prints to stdout.

  --verbose  expand LOW advisories to line numbers
  --json     machine-readable payload (hits + cadence + score per file)
  --passes   editing-passes view: every category as a named pass with a count
  --score    graded machine-texture score 0-100 (accumulates weak evidence by
             density), shown next to the clean/flagged device gate. The score
             is a detection signal for benchmarking; it never changes "clean".

Quality is measured, not asserted: articulate-bench.py runs this over a labeled
corpus (articulate-corpus/human + /ai, some poles Pangram-grounded) and reports
recall on AI samples and specificity on human samples, gated for regressions.

Exit code is always 0 so a save is never blocked. A caller that wants a hard gate
can read the printed summary or the --json payload.
