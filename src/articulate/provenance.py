"""articulate.provenance -- the fixed words a writer's own declarations map to.

Everything here repeats what a writer declared about their own process: the
IPTC digital source type codes and labels, the assistance verbs, the input
methods, the review roles and the CRediT contributor roles. The tool never
infers origin; it may repeat origin a writer declares, and only through this
table. The origin-claim test exempts this module and no other.
