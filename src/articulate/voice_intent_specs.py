"""Built-in intent specs and the words that steer a new one.

A spec says what a draft must do and what it must leave out, in terms the
checker can measure: device limits, wanted moves and a few ranges. The
`zain` spec turns the author's standing prose rules into those terms and adds
his stated stance for posts: contrarian, polemical, asking what if and trying
the other person's shoes before judging.

# imagery-forward, playing the next moment forward, ideas that run like waves,

# (author, 2026-11-02: "Literary devices are important"), so the spec sets no
