"""Literary devices, named, with a reading of the work each one does.

A device is a tool. Antithesis, anaphora, tricolon, chiasmus, metaphor, simile
and motif all carry meaning in good writing, and the same shapes turn up as
filler in machine-default prose. The shape alone cannot tell the two apart;
the words inside it can. This module names every device it finds and reads
the sentence that holds it for three kinds of load:

  image    a word a reader can picture: a thing, a place, weather, a body, a
           sense verb (articulate.imagery_lex)
  anchor   a number, a date, a quotation, inline code, a link, a name, or a
           concrete technical thing (a file, a log, a test)
  stance   an argument joint (because, unless, which means) or a first-person
           verb that takes a position (I think, I saw, I doubt)

A device whose sentence carries none of these, or whose figure rests on a stock
vehicle (journey, tapestry, landscape, beacon) with no image or anchor beside
it, reads as `empty`. Every other device reads as `carries`, with the loads
listed. The verdict is a reading for the author to judge, never an edit.

Readers: the thirteen structural readers in articulate.devices, plus simile,
metaphor and motif here. Motif is an image noun that returns in three or more
paragraphs. Rhythm is reported as the spread of sentence lengths. Irony and
synecdoche depend on context these surface readers cannot see, so this module
names them as unread. Standard library only.
