"""The house voice applied to model output: a deterministic transform, located
notes, and a receipt.

transform runs the closed edit list from house_edits on text a model wrote,
verifies the candidate edit by edit, runs the meaning guard on the paragraphs
left in place, and returns the text with notes and an
articulate/house-receipt/v1 receipt. When any check fails it returns the
original text and names the reason. Everything else the spec asks for is a
note for the model, never an edit: the style rules' findings, and any
sentence that claims a human life (house/human-claim).

The house voice applies only to the model's own speech. It never reads the
personal voice store, and it is never applied to text a user wrote.
