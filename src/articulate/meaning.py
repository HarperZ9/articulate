articulate.meaning -- the meaning guard: does a rewrite keep the original's
surface facts?

`compare(original, rewrite)` extracts the invariants of both texts (see
articulate.invariants) and pairs them by normalized key, kind by kind, in
document order. Each invariant is reported as:

  kept     the same key appears in both texts.
  dropped  it is in the original and missing from the rewrite.
  added    it is in the rewrite and was not in the original.
  changed  an unmatched original item and an unmatched rewrite item of the same
           kind, paired in order: "10 ms" became "20 ms", "must" became "should".

The verdict is `preserved` when every invariant is kept, else `changed`.

What it does not prove: the invariants are surface proxies. A rewrite can keep
every one and still change the meaning, for example by moving a negation into
another clause, swapping the order of two numbers, or changing a word no
invariant covers. A reported change can also be harmless. A `preserved` verdict
is a screen, never a proof that two texts say the same thing. Standard library only.
