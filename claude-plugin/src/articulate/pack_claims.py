articulate.pack_claims -- claims that point at their evidence (rule pack `claims`).

  claim-without-evidence (LOW)   a sentence makes a claim a reader would want
                                 to check (a superlative, a speed or accuracy
                                 figure, a guarantee, "proven", "secure",
                                 "works with") and neither it nor the next
                                 sentence points at the thing itself: a link, a
                                 command or path in code, a number with its
                                 unit or count, a named test or file, a figure.

Each label carries the document's coverage: how many claim sentences the pack
found and how many of them point at evidence, so the share is always read with
its denominator. `coverage(text)` returns the same numbers for a report.

Two things limit the reading. The claim list is a closed set of the claim words
product copy leans on, so a claim phrased another way is not counted. And a
pointer is matched by its shape: a link that points at the wrong page still
counts as a pointer. The pack reports and never gates on its own; a domain
profile decides the tier. Standard library only.
