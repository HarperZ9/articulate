"""Domain profiles: a register profile plus rule packs for one kind of writing.

A domain profile starts from a register profile in articulate.profiles and
adds rule packs (articulate.rules_ext) that run after the detector. The
detector and the register profiles stay as published, so `normative-spec`
keeps its findings, and the RFC keyword rules run only under `rfc-keywords`.

  ux-microcopy        UI strings: length, case, vague errors, link text. Strict.
  code-review         review comments: condescension, absolutes, requests with
                      no reason. Flavored, so the pack reports and the banned
                      devices still gate.
  plain-language      reading grade, long sentences, wordy phrases. Strict.
  controlled-english  sentence length, one instruction per sentence, idioms,
                      phrasal verbs, vague pronouns. Strict. It claims no
                      conformance to ASD-STE100 or any other specification.
  rfc-keywords        the normative-spec register plus RFC 2119 and RFC 8174
                      keyword consistency.
  product-copy        READMEs, release notes and listings read from the user's
                      side: claims point at evidence, the lead says what the
                      tool does for the reader, a mission line exists.
                      Flavored, so these report and the banned devices gate.
  note                a personal note to someone you know: no stock opener and
                      no closing offer (both gate), office words and length
                      reported. Flavored.
  author-voice        the author's own first-person text. Narrative slop, so
                      no device gates; em-dashes are still reported. Literary
                      devices that carry an image, an anchor or a stance pass;
                      an empty one is reported. Claims are still checked
                      against evidence, and edits planned under this profile
                      keep the register (articulate.voice_register) and the
                      author's own terms.
  publication         research and published findings. The research profile
                      plus claim evidence and analogy-map advice: an analogy
                      that carries the argument should point at a testable
                      map. Both report in LOW; neither gates.

A domain may carry `gate_promote` (pack categories that gate under a flavored
profile) and `freeze` (terms an edit planned under the profile must keep).

`load_profile(name)` resolves a domain or register profile name, and `load`
also takes a writing mode (a name with a slash). Every place outside the
pinned detector files that resolves a profile name goes through here.
Standard library only.
