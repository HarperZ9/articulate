"""Series review: patterns a reader notices across several documents.

analyze_corpus reads two or more documents (or one, with single=True, for its
structural checks) and returns findings. Each finding names its category, the
documents and lines it rests on, the measured numbers, what the pattern costs
a reader, what the author could do, and what the finding does not show. No
finding proposes replacement text, and no finding gates.

Standard library only. No network and no model.
