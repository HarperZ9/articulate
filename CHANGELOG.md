# Changelog

All notable changes to `articulate-writing` are recorded here. The package uses
semantic versioning. This is the package version. The detector ruleset carries its
own `RULESET_SEMVER`, which a receipt records so a replay knows which rules ran.

## 0.4.0

Added a stdio MCP server that runs from a bare install.

The existing MCP surface is built on fastmcp, which is declared under the `mcp`
extra. A plain `pip install articulate-writing` produced a package whose MCP
entry point raised `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastmcp'` the moment a
host launched it. The install reported success and the server never started.

- `articulate.local_mcp` serves the same five tools over stdio JSON-RPC 2.0
  (protocol `2025-06-18`) with nothing but the standard library, plus
  `articulate.status` and `articulate.doctor`. `doctor` reports which tools run
  local (`check`, `score`) and which need an LLM backend (`judge`, `fix`,
  `polish`), so a host with no backend knows what it still gets.
- New console script `articulate-mcp`. The fastmcp server stays available under
  the `[mcp]` extra as `articulate.mcp_server`.
- The tool bodies are unchanged and shared. Both transports call the same
  `do_check`, `do_score`, `do_judge`, `do_fix` and `do_polish`, and a test parses
  the fastmcp module for its `@mcp.tool` functions to assert the stdio server
  exposes every one of them. The two surfaces cannot drift apart.
- `tests/test_version_alignment.py` binds `pyproject.toml`, `articulate.__version__`
  and the version the MCP server reports. The three had no guard tying them
  together, so a release could ship reporting the previous version.
- The publish workflow now pins its actions by commit SHA rather than by moving
  tag, checks the release tag against the declared version, records artifact
  digests, resolves every console script in a clean venv, and rebuilds a wheel
  from the sdist before uploading.

## 0.3.0

Added three cadence detectors for prose that reads clean under the earlier ruleset
yet still carries a machine rhythm a reader hears.

- Demonstrative summary-beat, "That is the ... half / side / piece / layer / angle
  / story / trick". Tier MEDIUM, so it gates under a strict profile. A compound noun
  like "That is the side effect" and a plain "That is the file" do not fire.
- Two-imperative parallel slogan, "Verb the X, verb the Y." Tier LOW and advisory,
  since an everyday instruction is often an imperative pair. It anchors to a full
  line of two comma-joined bare-verb clauses, and a determiner or pronoun opener
  blocks it.
- Evaluative fragment opener, "Strong foundation." Tier LOW and advisory,
  paragraph-initial only, and fragment-shaped so a full sentence does not match.

Detector internals:

- Ruleset semver moves 0.4.0 to 0.5.0, and `FRAGMENT_OPENER` folds into the ruleset
  fingerprint, so a replay against an older receipt reports the ruleset change
  explicitly.
- A verse genre suppresses the two new LOW categories.
- Every new pattern uses bounded quantifiers and stays covered by the ReDoS safety
  test.
- The demonstrative extension fires on none of a 26-snippet human control corpus.

Tests: 151 pass.

## 0.2.0

Detector expanded to the full device catalogue. It reached 18 HIGH, 55 MEDIUM, and
12 LOW tells, plus 7 standard-library statistical advisories. The tells cover
lexical and structural devices, cadence, delivery, and formatting.
False-positive-controlled against a 22-snippet human corpus with zero false HIGH or
MEDIUM. Ruleset semver 0.4.0. Tests: 143 pass. Published to PyPI as
`articulate-writing`.

## 0.1.0

First public release. The core detector, register profiles, writing modes, the
genre axis, per-span mixed-authorship verdicts, an "unverifiable" sub-threshold
calibration, binary fail-closed input guards, the benchmark, the editor layer, the
CLI, the LSP and SARIF surfaces, receipts, the content-free audit receipt, and the
MCP server. The core runs standard-library-only with no network call.
Source-available under FSL-1.1-MIT. Published to PyPI as `articulate-writing`.
