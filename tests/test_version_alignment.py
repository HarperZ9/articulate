"""The declared version must agree everywhere it is written down.

articulate writes its version in three places: ``pyproject.toml`` for the built
distribution, ``articulate.__version__`` for anything that asks the running
package, and the README line that tells a reader what is on PyPI. The MCP
server reports the module value in its ``serverInfo``, so a client asking which
version it is talking to gets that one rather than the wheel's.

Nothing tied them together. A release could ship 0.4.0 while the module and
every MCP client reported 0.3.0, and the suite would stay green. The publish
workflow reads ``pyproject.toml`` and never the module, so it could not catch it
either.

The version is read with a regex rather than ``tomllib``. ``requires-python`` is
``>=3.9`` and ``tomllib`` arrived in 3.11, so importing it here would make this
guard the reason the 3.9 and 3.10 jobs fail.
