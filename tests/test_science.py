"""Scientific-communication modes: making a hard proof or whitepaper legible
without losing rigor, and never asserting the result is correct.

The boundary is load-bearing and tested at the artifact: a clean gate or a Match
receipt screens the prose under a named ruleset; it says nothing about whether the
theorem is true. The editor also masks every math span so a rewrite cannot alter a
formula, a quantifier order, or an inequality direction.
