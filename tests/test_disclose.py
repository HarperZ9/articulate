"""The disclosure statement (PLAN section 5.4, ARTICULATE-PLAN step 4).

It never lists a model as an author; it refuses a no-tool claim when the log
records assistance; it takes its verb from the recorded task; it refuses to
leave out a recorded assistance entry; and input methods stay out unless the
writer includes them. These tests guard those lines.
