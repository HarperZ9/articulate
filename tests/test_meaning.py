"""The meaning guard: surface invariants a rewrite must keep.

Each case pairs a faithful rewrite, which must read `preserved`, with an
unfaithful one, which must report the named status for that kind. The faithful
side is the false-positive control; the unfaithful side fails if the kind's
extractor is removed. One test pins the documented blind spot, so the
does-not-prove statement stays honest.
